(** * Testcases for [Write ... using ... as ...] *)

(** * Test 1
    Base case: valid rewrite statement
    in a hypothesis, with correct expected result.
*)
Lemma test_write_using_as_1: forall x y: nat, 5 * (x + y) = 10 -> 5 * x + 5 * y = 10 .
Proof.
    intros x y.
    intros h.
    Write h using (forall n m p : nat, n * (m + p) = n * m + n * p) as (5 * x + 5 * y = 10).
    assert_hyp_has_type @h constr:(5 * x + 5 *y = 10).
    assumption.
Qed.

(** * Test 2
    Error case: valid rewrite statement
    in a hypothesis, but with wrong expected result.
*)
Lemma test_write_using_as_2: forall x y: nat, 5 * (x + y) = 10 -> 5 * x + 5 * y = 10 .

    in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.
