(** * Test 1
    Without intuition, this call to [waterprove] should fail.
*)
Require Import Waterproof.set_intuition.Disabled.
Lemma test_1: forall A B: Prop, A /\ B -> B /\ A.
    let result () := waterprove (Control.goal ()) [] false in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.

(** * Test 2
    With intuition, [waterprove] should be able to solve it.

Require Import Waterproof.set_intuition.Enabled.
Lemma test_2: forall A B: Prop, A /\ B -> B /\ A.
