Several tactics to finish a proof at the point
where it has become trivial
(e.g. when there is an assumption that states the goal,
or when the goal has the form [X = X]).

(** * Then ... holds by assumption
    Try to prove the goal with the fact 
    that a hypothesis (supposedly) exists that states the goal.

    Arguments:
        - [target_goal: constr], expression that should equal
            the definition of the goal.
    
    Raises exceptions:
        - [AutomationFailure], if [target_goal] is not logically equivalent
            to the actual goal under focus. 
            Only print a warning in case 
            [target_goal] is logically equivalent,
            but not directly equivalent without rewriting.
        - [AssumptionError], if there is no hypothesis that has the same
            type as the goal.
