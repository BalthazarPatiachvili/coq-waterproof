(** * check_hypothesis
    Checks whether or not a hypothesis, in form of a [constr], is indeed known to be true in the
    current context.

    Arguments:
        - [s: ident], the name/identifier of the repsective hypothesis.
        - [t: constr], the previously mentioned hypothesis.

    Does:
        - checks whether or not the [constr] that has [s] as its identifier is equal
          to the [constr] [t].

    Raises Exceptions:
        - [WeKnowError], if the hypothesis [t] does not exist.
