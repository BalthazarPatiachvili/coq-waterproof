### Cosmin:
- `decidability_db.v` has no author.
- ~~Many document headers are not yet coqdoc (`(*` i.o. `(**`))~~

### Adrian/Tudor
- ~~Rename & document `myauto`.~~ 
    - UPDATE: Never mind, we deprecated `myauto` anyway. Sorry...
- Document what each database does.
    Should be in the SUM,
    but preferably also somewhere in the repro.
    e.g. in `new_Waterproof/load_database/README.md`.

### Lulof:
- Update `Waterproof.v` when done.
- ~~Move printing statements from `selected_databases.v` to the file of the respective database.~~
- Testcases for `waterprove.v` and databases stuff
- ~~TODO: only first lemma~~
- ~~Cleanup `waterprove`: remove stuff that does not work.~~
- ~~Seach depth files.~~
- Last four tactics
- Fix testcases that use hint databases -> import all databases
