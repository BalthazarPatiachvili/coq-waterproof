Goal True.
(* To use the default, i.e. [core], 
    pass [Some ([])] to Std.auto
*)
assert_string_equal (fake_auto) "No database provided".

(* To use [with *], 
    i.e. all imported databases that Coq can find, 
    pass [None] to Std.auto
*)
assert_string_equal (fake_auto with *) "Empty list provided".

(* To use [with somedb], 
    pass a list of idents
    (e.g. [Some ((@somedb)::[])]) to Std.auto.
*)
assert_string_equal (fake_auto with nocore) "List provided".
Abort.
