(* lra only works in the [R_scope] *)
Local Open Scope R_scope.
Lemma zero_lt_one: 0 < 1.
Proof.
    ltac1:(lra).
Qed.

(* This axiom does not make sense, 
    but therefore we can be sure that [waterprove]
    does not know it without *explicitly* being told to use it.*)
Local Parameter x_var : R.
Local Parameter H_x_is_10 : x_var = 10.
Lemma x_is_10 : x_var = 10.
Proof.
  exact H_x_is_10.
Qed.

(** * Testcases for [By ... it holds that ... : ...] *)

(** * Test 1
    Base case: intoduce a sublemma with a lemma that proves it
    immediately.

    NOTE: [waterprove] can apparently also find
    [zero_lt_one] by itself.
*)
Lemma test_by_it_holds_1: 0 = 0.
Proof.
    By zero_lt_one it holds that (0 < 1).
Abort.

(** * Test 2
    Base case: intoduce a sublemma with a lemma that proves it
    immediately. 
    The sublemma cannot be proven without the given lemma!

*)
Lemma test_by_it_holds_2: True.
Proof.
    (* This is just to test if the extra lemma is really needed: *)
    let failure () := It holds that (x_var = 10) in
    assert_raises_error failure.
    
    By (H_x_is_10) it holds that (x_var = 10).
Abort.

(** * Test 3
    Corner case: try a sublemma that cannot be solved,
    at least not with the default lemmas and the provided lemma.
*)
Lemma test_by_it_holds_3: 0 = 0.
Proof.
    let result () := 
        By zero_lt_one it holds that (1 > 2)
    in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.


(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** * Testcases for [It holds that ... : ...] *)

(** * Test 1
    Base case: intoduce a sublemma that can be proven immediately.
*)
Lemma test_it_holds_1: 0 = 0.
Proof.
    It holds that (True) (i).
    assert_hyp_has_type @i constr:(True).
Abort.


(** * Test 2
    Corner case: try a sublemma that cannot be solved,
    at least not with the default lemmas [waterprove] uses.
*)
Lemma test_it_holds_2: 0 = 0.
Proof.
    let result () := 
        It holds that (1 > 2)
    in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.

(** * Example for the SUM.
    Somewhat more realistic context.
*)

Open Scope nat_scope.
Inductive even : nat -> Prop :=
    even0 : even 0
  | evenS : forall x:nat, even x -> even (S (S x)).

Lemma it_holds_example: forall x:nat, x > 1 /\ x < 3 -> even x.
Proof.
    intros x h.
    It holds that (x = 2) (i).
    rewrite (i). (* Change the goal to "even 2"*)
    apply evenS. (* Change the goal to "even 0"*)
    apply even0.
Qed.


(* Test 4: Check what error is thrown when a hypothesis identifier is already in use.*)
Goal forall x:nat, x > 1 /\ x < 3 -> even x.
Proof.
    intros x h.
    Fail It holds that (x = 2) (h).
    It holds that (x = 2) (i).
Abort.
