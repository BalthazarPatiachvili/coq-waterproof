(** * Unfold
    Rewrite a function by its definition,
    in the goal or in a hypothesis.
    Nothing more than a custom notation for the build-in [unfold].

    Exactly same implementation as in Ltac2's source file [Notations.v].
    The only difference is that the [U] is capitalized.
    Note that the [opt(clause)] syntactic class handles the optional
    keyword [in].

    Arguments:
        - [targets: constr] or [targets: constr list],
            the target function to unfold, 
            or the target functions (separated by [,]) to unfold.
        - [in_clause: constr], optional suffix with syntax 
            [unfold f in h] for some [h],
            where [h] is the hypothesis to rewrite the function [f] in.
            If omitted, [f] is rewritten in the goal.
